For a component-level breakdown of the MyFakeCelebrity project, let's detail each main component and its interactions within the application. This will provide a clear understanding of the structure and functionality at a granular level, ideal for developers or team members familiar with React and web development.

### Title: MyFakeCelebrity Component Documentation

#### Description:
MyFakeCelebrity is a React-based application designed for managing and interacting with user-generated prompts. It leverages React Router for navigation and includes a variety of components for user interface management, prompt handling, and category organization.

#### Component Overview:

##### `App`
- **Location**: `src/App.jsx`
- **Description**: Serves as the root component that sets up the Router and wraps the entire application. It orchestrates the main layout, linking the header, main content area, and footer across different routes.

##### `Header`
- **Location**: `src/components/Header.jsx`
- **Description**: Displays the application's main navigation header. Includes links to the Home page. It is present across all pages for consistent navigation.

##### `Footer`
- **Location**: `src/components/Footer.jsx`
- **Description**: Displays the footer information across the application, containing copyright text. Ensures consistent presence at the bottom of all pages.

##### `HomePage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/HomePage.jsx`
- **Description**: The landing page of the application, providing links to all major functions like viewing and creating prompts.

##### `ProfilePage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/ProfilePage.jsx`
- **Description**: Allows users to view and manage their profile information, including options to edit or delete their profile.

##### `CategoriesPage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/CategoriesPage.jsx`
- **Description**: Lists different categories of prompts (e.g., Few-Shot, Zero-Shot, Chain of Thought) with navigation links to filtered prompt views.

##### `CreatePromptPage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/CreatePromptPage.jsx`
- **Description**: Provides a form for users to create new prompts, including fields for title, description, and category.

##### `EditPromptPage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/EditPromptPage.jsx`
- **Description**: Offers a form similar to CreatePromptPage, but pre-filled with existing prompt data for editing.

##### `PromptsPage`
- **Location**: `src/pages/PromptsPage.jsx`
- **Description**: Displays all available prompts with links to detailed views or edit options.

##### `PageOne`, `PageTwo`, `PageThree`
- **Locations**:
  - `src/components/PageOne.jsx`
  - `src/components/PageTwo.jsx`
  - `src/components/PageThree.jsx`
- **Descriptions**: Placeholder pages that demonstrate how to add additional content sections to the application. Each serves as a template for further development.

#### Usage and Navigation:
- **Component Integration**: Components are integrated using React Router, ensuring seamless navigation and component rendering based on URL paths.
- **Navigational Flow**: The Header component provides consistent top-level navigation, guiding users through different sections of the application accessible from the main routes defined in `App.jsx`.

#### Development Guidelines:
- **Modular Development**: Focus on maintaining modularity in components to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
- **State Management**: Consider using context or state management libraries if application complexity increases.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure that components are responsive, using CSS modules or styled-components for layout adjustments across different devices.

#### Accessibility:
- **ARIA Attributes**: Use appropriate ARIA roles and properties to enhance accessibility, especially in dynamic content like forms and navigation.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard to support accessibility standards.

### Final Thoughts:
This component documentation is designed to give developers an immediate understanding of the application’s structure and the role of each component within it. It’s an essential tool for both current maintenance and future development, streamlining the onboarding process for new team members and providing a reference for seasoned developers.
